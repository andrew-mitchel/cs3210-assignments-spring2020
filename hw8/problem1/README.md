# HW8 — Problem 1

## Problem statement

"Hey I heard u r learning about file IO" — that was a message from Bob. Everyone has been working from home for several weeks now, and Bob seemingly had extra time for his C++ adventures. "A 'how are you' would be nice", you mumbled to yourself and typed back: "Yes". Not noticing your lack of enthusiasm to share more, Bob shot back: 

> Awsm I need ur help 

> Can u write this function for me?

> I want to load a tic tac toe game from a file but cant get it working

"Oh, brother", you sighed, typed back "Sure", and opened the Github link.

Using Bob's tests [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw8-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) as a guidance, implement `load_game` function that takes a file path and loads a Tic-Tac-Toe game board/state ( `game_state`) from the specified file. **Do not modify the tests**. See the [`input` subdirectory](input) for the two text files used in the tests.
