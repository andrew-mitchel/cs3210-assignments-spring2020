# HW7 â€” Problem 1

## Problem statement

Alice came by while you were working on Bob's [`point` type](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-spring2020/tree/master/hw6/problem1), watched you for a couple of minutes, and said: "You know, I've been thinking of creating a small geometry library for working with points and rectangles. I already wrote the tests for it, do you want to take it over?" In a brief moment of madness, you enthusiastically agreed.

Use Alice's code [here](https://repl.it/@agurtovoy/hw7-problem1) ([`main.cpp`](main.cpp)) and your solution for [hw6/problem1](https://github.com/uiowa-cs-3210-0001/cs3210-assignments-spring2020/tree/master/hw6/problem1) as a starting point. **Do not modify the tests**.

Remember that the same feature that allows us to define multiple identically named functions in the same scope also allows us to define multiple constructors within the same `struct`. The stream output operator can have the same canonical signature we familiarized ourselves with during class ( `std::ostringstream` is a subclass of `std::ostream`).
